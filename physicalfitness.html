    <h1 class=section-spacing>IMPORTANCE OF STRENGTH TRAINING</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">Benefits of building muscle and strength for overall health.</p>
    
    <p>Your body fat percentage will increase over time if you don't do anything to replace the lean muscle you lose over time. Strength training can help you preserve and enhance your muscle mass at any age.</p>
           
    <h2>Strength training may also help you:</h2>
    <p><strong>1. Develop strong bones.</strong></p>     
    <ul>
        <li>By stressing your bones, strength training can increase bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>2. Manage your weight.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strength training can help you manage or lose weight, and it can increase your metabolism to help you burn more calories.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>3. Enhance your quality of life.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strength training may enhance your quality of life and improve your ability to do everyday activities. Strength training can also protect your joints from injury. Building muscle also can contribute to better balance and may reduce your risk of falls. This can help you maintain independence as you age.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>4. Manage chronic conditions.</strong></p>     
    <ul>
        <li>Strength training can reduce the signs and symptoms of many chronic conditions, such as arthritis, back pain, obesity, heart disease, depression and diabetes.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>5. Sharpen your thinking skills.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Some research suggests that regular strength training and aerobic exercise may help improve thinking and learning skills for older adults.</li>
    </ul>
           
           <h1 class="section-spacing">CARDIO VS. STRENGTH TRAINING</h1>
<p class="intro-text">A guide to choosing the right type of exercise for specific fitness goals.</p>
           
<h2>BENEFITS OF CARDIO</h2>
<p>Cardio is crucial for your health because it challenges your cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and this can have some amazing benefits for your body.</p>
           
<p><strong>1. Healthier heart and lungs:</strong> Cardio strengthens the capacity of your heart and lungs, improving your circulation and oxygen flow throughout your body. This increased efficiency lowers your risk of certain health concerns like heart disease, stroke, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and more.</p>
<p><strong>2. Stronger joints, bones, and muscles:</strong> With cardio, you’re forcing your muscles, joints, and bones to adapt and grow so that they can perform the task you’re asking them to do. This helps build muscle mass and bone density, which will play a big role in the quality of your life as you get older.</p>
<p><strong>3. Lower cholesterol & blood sugar levels:</strong> Cardio can help manage your blood sugars and reduce your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad” cholesterol levels. It also boosts your high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or “good” cholesterol, which can help prevent blockage in your arteries.</p> 
<p><strong>4. Increased brain functioning:</strong> Cardio exercise doesn’t just support a healthier body, but a healthier brain. Research shows that cardio exercise could help improve your memory and cognitive functioning. Especially a workout like boxing that requires explosive and quick movement.</p> 
<p><strong>5. Improved immunity:</strong> All the benefits mentioned above also help build up your body’s immune health. Keeping your body healthy means it’s more prepared to handle any germ, disease, or toxin that comes your way.</p> 
           
<h2>BENEFITS OF STRENGTH TRAINING</h2>
<p>The benefits of strength training include more than just building muscle! The stress you’re placing on your muscular system has a ton of additional benefits for your mind and body.</p>
<p><strong>1. Preserves and boosts muscle mass:</strong> Strength training can certainly help you on your way to building muscle mass or hypertrophy. But even if that isn’t your goal, healthy and strong muscles have real-world applications. And as you age, your muscle mass continues to decline. With strength training, you can preserve and even build your muscle mass to help improve your quality of life as you get older.</p> 
<p><strong>2. Builds stronger bones & joints:</strong> It's not just your muscles getting stronger! That stress you’re putting on your body as you drop into a squat or lift a dumbbell also builds stronger bones and joints. This helps reduce your risk of bone-related health concerns like osteoporosis or bone fractures.</p> 
<p><strong>3. Protects you from injury & illness:</strong> Reducing your risk of falls is a major perk of strength training, especially as you get older. But strength training could also help reduce your risk of many chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, joint pain, back pain, and more.</p> 
<p><strong>4. Sharpens your cognitive thinking:</strong> Some studies also share that strength training can help improve your processing speed, memory, focus, attention, and other executive function skills.</p>
